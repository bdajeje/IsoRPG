# Conversation file syntax

Conversation elements are delimited by '|'.
A conversation file is formated as:

-------------------------------------------------------
text of png to show|png head sprite filepath
number of answers
answer 1 text|answer action
answer 2 text|answer action
...
-------------------------------------------------------

Example:
------------------------------------------------------
Welcome dear young adventurer !|happy.png
2
Hey mister :)|c:1
You are weird, bye!|a:quit
What's your name?|asking.png
1
My name is Nani|a:quit
-------------------------------------------------------

In the previous example the conversation will show the text "Welcome dear young adventurer !" and the PNG head sprite will be "happy.png".
There are two asnwers to this step. 
First answer is "Hey mister :)" and lead to conversation step 1 (the "c:1" part, 'c' stands for continue).
Second answer is "You are weird, bye!" and exit the conversation ('a' for action then the quit action)
If selecting first answer then dialog continues to step 1 and displays: "What's your name?" with a new PNJ head sprite "asking.png".
There is only one answer to this step "My name is Nani" and this answer exists the dialog.
